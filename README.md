# Customer-Management-System

Customer Management System (CMS): ABC company management wants a simple  CMS for their retails shops with the following features.

– A company has decided to launch a project in phases.

– Application would be capturing five fields for a customer : customer name, phone number, Bill amount, Bill date and address

– In phase 1 two types of customer data are collected. One is the lead and  another is a Regular_customer. A lead is a person who comes to shop but  does not buy anything. He just enquires and goes away. A Regular_customer  is a person who comes and buys things (actually he does financial  transaction).

– When it’s a lead only customer name and phone is compulsory. But for a  Regular_customer all fields are compulsory. System should have a provision to add newvalidation rules seamlessly and these validation rules should be flexible and reusable to apply to the system
